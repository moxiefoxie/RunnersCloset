# RunnersCloset
An iOS app to help track miles put on running shoes. This will integrate with Apple Fitness's run history to make run tracking as simple as possible. User's recent runs will import directly into the app allowing them to select which shoes from their closet they used on the run. The app will alert users when they are nearing the EOL for their shoes.
